YITH WooCommerce Membership allows you to create custom membership for the contents of your shop.


== Description ==

Do you have particular contents that you want to reveal only to specific users? The best solution is taking advantage of a powerful membership system that will let you control the access to certain products, posts or pages. An easy-to-use management offers you the freedom to set the level of access of your contents with a simple click.

In this way, all users of your shop will be able to purchase their membership with few steps, following a flexible process that will convert them in members, granting them the visualization of all your extra contents.
